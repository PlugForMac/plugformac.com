## Installing / Getting started

Here's what you need to fire this site up locally

```shell
$ gh repo clone wulkano/plugformac.com
$ cd plugformac.com && yarn install
```

This clones the repo and installs dependencies. After that, run

```shell
$ yarn dev
```

To start the Next.js development server.
